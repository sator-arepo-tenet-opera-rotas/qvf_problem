Quiescent Flux, or just “Queef,” follows from the definition of continuous jets:


SJs, similar to continuous jets (CJs), are studied by examining changes in the ﬂuid
velocity, density, temperature, and concentration of the component ﬂuids both in the jet
and in the ambient ﬂuid. The readers are encouraged to consult a few available review
articles for general experimental and simulation observations with SJs including the article
by Glezer and Amitay (2002). In this chapter, we explore analytical models of SJs for two-
dimensional (2D) plane SJs and axisymmetric SJs in cylindrical and spherical coordinates.
The models start with the most simpliﬁed case for an SJ in a quiescent and inﬁnitely large
environment. We then gradually introduce more complex background ﬂows (including
coﬂow and crossﬂow) or interaction with a wall in the case of a wall SJ. The main results
are based on a series of publications (Krishnan and Mohseni 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Xia and
Mohseni 2010, 2011). We start by a brief discussion of the SJ actuators, the experimental
setup, and a model of the actuator



A nondimensional stroke ratio (L/d) and the Reynolds number (Re) have beenidentiﬁed as
key actuator operational parameters that inﬂuence an SJ (Smith and Glezer 1998). For the
cavity-diaphragm setup used in this experiment,they are obtained from an incompressible
ﬂow model, where it is assumed that the volume displaced by the membrane is equal
to the volume ejected from the oriﬁce (Figure 1.4). As a result, it is quite important to
measure the piezodiaphragm displacement during the operation ofthe actuatorto properly
estimate the stroke ratio of the ejecting jet from the actuator. This has been achieved with
the laser setup described earlier (see Krishnan and Mohseni, 2009a, for details).

Reynolds number. The jet velocity, defined by the Reynolds number, 

R = uL / ν = puL / μ 

where:

    ρ is the density of the fluid (SI units: kg/m3)
    u is the flow speed (m/s)
    L is a characteristic length (m)
    μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s or N·s/m2 or kg/(m·s))
    ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m2/s).

is crucial in jet impingement processes since it strongly influences the local, line-averaged, and area-averaged Nusselt number 

The Reynolds number is therefore explicitly seen to vary with both membrane driving
frequency and amplitude, with the stroke ratio appearing to be independent of frequency.
This independence of stroke ratio on frequency is not accurate as the use of a piezoelectric
diaphragm as a driver gives rise to a coupling between the frequency and deﬂection, and
consequently the stroke ratio. However, for purposes of calculating the jet parameters,
the simple model described earlier serves the purpose. In summary, Equations 1.4 and
1.5 express the dependency of the critical actuator parameters on the diaphragm driving
frequency and deﬂection amplitude.


Incompressibility Check*
We are now in the position to verify the validity of the incompressibility assumptionused in
the preceding calculations. In the following experiments, the actuation frequency is of the
order of 1000 Hz and L is of an approximate magnitude of 0.01 m. Therefore, the velocity
is of the order of 10 m/s.As a result,the operational Mach number for the actuators is quite
below 0.3 that makes the ﬂow virtually incompressible.


*Eddy Viscosity Approach to Modeling SJs*
The last century has seen a signiﬁcant eﬀort in the scientiﬁc community in developing
models for the averaged ﬂow properties of laminar and turbulent CJs. An elegant and
strikingly simple solution for modeling a laminar continuos jet was oﬀered by Schlichting
(1933). He found that an axisymmetric laminar jet could have a self-similar solution.
He predicted a linear spreading rate for the jet, where the spreading rate was controlled
by the ﬂuid viscosity. This result was later extended to axisymmetric turbulent jets by
supplementing the kinematic viscosity with an eddy viscosity to compensate for the
enhanced momentum mixing in a turbulent CJ (Schlichting 1979). The enhanced eddy
viscosity could be easily calculated from the jet spreading rate.

In a similar fashion, it has been recently hypothesized (Krishnan and Mohseni 2009a,
2009b) that the enhanced mixing and spreading rate of an SJ above what has been observed
for a related turbulent CJ could be attributed to an enhanced eddy viscosity due to the
pulsatile nature of an SJ.

To obtain the volume displaced by the membrane, the shape of the deﬂected membrane
and the amplitude at the center of the membrane are required (Krishnan and Mohseni
2009a). The shape is obtained from the classical theory of plates (Timoshenko 1999)
